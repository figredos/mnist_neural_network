# MNIST Neural Network

Building neural networks using the MNIST dataset has become a classic problem in the field of machine learning and deep learning.

MNIST, a collection of handwritten digits, serves as a fundamental benchmark for testing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms, particularly neural networks. It's a simpler problem and an ideal starting point to grasp the concepts of neural networks and their training process.

This is a simple implementation of a neural network based on this classical problem.

To run the code, simply download the jupyter file and run it, it should download the required packages and run without problem. I tried implementing a somewhat Object Oriented approach to the neural network, also type coding it.

Hope you enjoy =)
